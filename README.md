# reSizem
A Python Command-Line Script to Resize and Convert Images

## About 
This is a simple script I created to simplify the annoying task of having to resize or convert images. This script utilizes argparse and PIL to parse the command-line arguments and resize the image respectively. 

## To Do
* More extensive testing
* Fully implement resizing to decrease file size
* Improve error handling and input suggestions
